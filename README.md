# Terror in Tulum
An _Eldritch Dice_ scenario for 4 players

> Two hundred years and more they have leaned or squatted there, while the vines have crawled and the trees have swelled and spread.
> They are almost hidden now in lawless luxuriances of green and guardian shrouds of shadow; but the small-paned windows still stare
> shockingly, as if blinking through a lethal stupor which wards off madness by dulling the memory of unutterable things.
	- H.P. Lovecraft, "The Picture in the House"

## Background

### Spawn of Shub Niggurath
The mystery of the disappearance of the Mayan civilization in 900 A.D. is revealed. The once mighty civilization continues to exist
underground, nursing the spawn of the Ancient Shub Niggurath and drinking the mother's milk in the corrupt belief that it offers
immortality. In fact, it corrupts and absorbs them into one of Shub Niggurath's many mammary inter-dimensional protrusions that feed
her embryos left in the mortal planes.

### Dr. Valle's *** to discover the missing Mayan civilization
Finding and rescuing Dr. Valle is the objective for the player characters. His xxx to Tulum is where he believed he uncover more
evidence to support his theory that an underground network of rivers and tunnels connect the various Mayan temples and sacred sites.
He believed following these tunnels might lead to great temples yet to be discovered and, perhaps, an explanation as to the abrupt
disappearance of the Mayan civilization in the 9th century.

But Dr. Valle has been corrupted by the mother's milk, believing it will give him immortality and a portal to other dimensions. He
has sacrificed his team members and other members of a recent search party, forcing them to become one with mother by performing the
hideous ritual of removing their living heart and integrating it with the mammary of Shub Niggurath, leaving their soul-less body to
be inhabited and controlled by her embryonic spawn.
